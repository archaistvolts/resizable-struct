# flexible-struct

A single buffer layout library for structs with flexible fields.

# About

User defined `Layout` fields are first in memory with order determined by Zig.
Flexible fields are second and sorted by descending alignment. With no padding,
flexible offsets can be calculated in constant time (see `calcOffsets()`).

# Features

1. Support all structs: auto, extern, packed
1. Constant time field access.
1. APIs: Layout, Self and bytes.  Users can ptrCast between them.
1. Computed fields.
1. LSP cooperation. Avoid created/refified types which break autocomplete.

## Usage

Add a `pub const flexible_array_capacities` decl to your `Layout` which maps
flexible array fields to their capacities.

```zig
const Layout = struct {
        capacity: u8,
        flexible: [*]u8 = undefined,
        computed: [*]u8 = undefined,

        pub const flexible_array_capacities = .{
            .flexible = .capacity,
            .computed = .computedLen,
        };

        pub fn computedLen(_: *const @This()) usize {
            return 68;
        }
    };

    const Model = Struct(Layout, .{});
    const initlayout = Layout{ .capacity = 42 };
    var buf: Model.Buf(&initlayout) align(Model.ALIGN) = undefined; // buffer must be aligned
    const model = try Model.initBuffer(&buf, &initlayout);
    try testing.expectEqual(42, model.value(.capacity));
    try testing.expectEqual(42, model.slice(.flexible).len);
    try testing.expectEqual(42, model.asLayout().capacity); // Self <-> Layout
    try testing.expectEqual(42, Model.fromLayout(model.asLayout()).value(.capacity));
    try testing.expectEqual(68, model.slice(.computed).len);
    try testing.expectEqual(136, model.sizeInBytes()); // 24+42+68(~8)=134(~8)=136
}
```
